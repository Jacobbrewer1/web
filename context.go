// CoreContext provides a context that is canceled when an interrupt signal is received.
//
// This function creates a context that listens for operating system signals such as
// `os.Interrupt` and `syscall.SIGTERM`. It is useful for gracefully shutting down
// applications when these signals are received.
//
// Note:
//   - This is defined as a variable to allow users of the package to override it if needed.
//     For example, users may want to use a different signal or context for testing or customization.
